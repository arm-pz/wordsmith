# Wordsmith

A portable Agent Skill for drafting, rewriting, editing, proofreading, and polishing text.

Wordsmith helps AI coding agents produce clearer, more concise, natural, and publication-ready writing while preserving the author's meaning and voice.

## Use when

Use Wordsmith when you need to:

- draft content from an idea or brief;
- rewrite or polish existing text;
- proofread grammar and spelling;
- improve clarity, flow, and concision;
- change tone or reading level;
- create headlines, titles, emails, or website copy;
- critique structure and audience fit;
- review accessibility and readability;
- prepare content for publication.

## Installation

Copy the following directory into the skills directory supported by your AI agent:

```text
skills/wordsmith/
```

Depending on the agent platform, that may be one of:

```text
.claude/skills/wordsmith/
.agents/skills/wordsmith/
.cursor/skills/wordsmith/
.qoder/skills/wordsmith/
```

Consult the documentation for the agent platform you use to determine the correct location.

Or install via the Skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add arm-pz/wordsmith --skill wordsmith
```

For Claude Code specifically:

```bash
npx skills add arm-pz/wordsmith --skill wordsmith --agent claude-code
```

## Usage

Invoke with a command:

```text
/wordsmith draft
/wordsmith rewrite
/wordsmith critique
/wordsmith audit
/wordsmith tighten
/wordsmith polish
/wordsmith final
```

Or describe the task naturally:

```text

## Design principles

Wordsmith should:

- preserve the author's intended meaning;
- preserve important facts, names, numbers, and quotations;
- avoid inventing facts, sources, statistics, or experiences;
- match the requested audience and tone;
- use clear and direct language;
- preserve the author's voice unless asked to change it;
- explain substantial changes;
- identify uncertainty instead of pretending to know;
- return the requested writing before lengthy commentary.

Wordsmith should not:

- silently change dates, numbers, names, or commitments;
- make unsupported claims sound certain;
- replace a personal voice with generic corporate language;
- rewrite everything when the user only requested proofreading;
- claim that content is factually correct without verification;
- add fake citations or sources.

## Development

The source repository is a Copier template.

Generate a new project:

```bash
copier copy https://github.com/arm-pz/agent-skill-template.git wordsmith
```

Update a previously generated project:

```bash
cd wordsmith
copier update
```

Copier stores the original answers in:

```text
.copier-answers.yml
```
